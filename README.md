- Accuracy: Aim for the best model accuracy, as reflected by the R-squared value, while ensuring controlled independent variable counts and outlier management.
- Business Insight: Produce a business memo that addresses whether there was a significant change in Brooklyn home purchase prices during the period studied.

### Criteria for Model Evaluation
- Observations: The dataset should include at least 13,000 entries.
- Degrees of Freedom: Strive for a model with 40 degrees of freedom or fewer.
